			Welcome fellow STEM students, are you having a hard time choosing on what to take after you graduate? Are you having second thoughts on what path to take? if yes, this is the perfect page for you.<br>
		<h2 style="text-align:center"> STEM  </h2><br>
			STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) is an educational program developed to prepare primary and secondary students for college and graduate study in the field of science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM). In addition to subject-specific learning, STEM aims to foster inquiring minds, logical reasoning, and collaboration skills. <br>
		<h2 style="text-align: center"> <ul>What are STEM subjects? </ul></h2> <br>
			As mentioned, STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, but a far wider range of academic disciplines fall under this description. Hereâ€™s a list of some of the other STEM courses you could study:

	<h2><li>Aerospace Engineering</li></h2>
	<b>Aerospace engineering</b> is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft.It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering.

	"Aeronautical engineering" was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include vehicles operating in outer space, the broader term "aerospace engineering" has come into common use. Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as "rocket science".
